# CPU (per-core) benchmark by finding primes
this is an implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes\
it can retrieve around 80,000 primes in 6ms on my processor, what can it do on yours?\
to try this program out, download the repo and run the executable inside its folder **(only run executables from people you trust)**

# Making sense of the result
the higher the number of *iterations*, the faster your CPU's per-core performance
